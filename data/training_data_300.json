That is a belief that the human to human connection is true and genuine, and that machines can not do that. And that our soul, I think there's also a belief, once you believe there's a soul, that even when our body dies, the soul potentially continues. So I think that may or may not be true, but I think I'm choosing to believe it. And I think a lot of the religions have that element. I think religions also have elements of superstition, which is why they're losing traction. And I think there's something, some memories that people have of others and the affinity they feel. It seems plausible that even when our body dies, our soul goes on. Because you brought up meaning, that's such an important part of the book, the notion that AI can, if we're overly focused on working being a reason for existing, that there will be this loss of meaning.

How should people be using AI right now if they want to be on that path? So one of the things I'm doing in the companies that I'm running, or advising, or investing in, is I'm saying, first of all, every company needs to have what I call a chief AI officer. And it's a role I made up, was teaching at Abundance360 this year, and it is not someone who's building a large language model for you, or writing code for you. It's an individual who understands what's going on in the terrain, because we're seeing not hundreds or thousands, tens of thousands of startups. Everybody, you know, you can start an AI company now with literally spare time in your garage.

And that's like remarkable where some of the same hinge points in history so specific are occurring again but with the opposite outcome. A major one that's happening is, you know, there's actually a confrontation between journalists and founders, entrepreneurs and, you know, and reporters in the early 20th century. That was like, you know, Ida Tarbell and all the quote muckrakers went and attacked Rockefeller and all the captains of industry, demonized them, laid the groundwork for the trust busting and essentially the government to take over and quasi-nationalize a bunch of those companies with regulations and so on and so forth.

Or they own depreciating assets. And that's what cash is. It's a depreciating asset, because the more money they print, the more money that money loses value. It's the reason why the bank wants you to have your money there. So they can take it and use it and invest it so much and be like, hey, it's just sitting there. I'm going to give you 50 cents on whatever you had in it. And so the idea of ownership was, yo, if we can just start owning everything, no matter if it's just a stock, that's powerful.

And I've had moments where people have done that for me, but I think that's probably what I, my stable concept of myself is that I'm willing to, to the greatest degree I'm capable of take responsibility for others.

I was blown away by your book. I was moved emotionally, deeply. I cannot remember the last book that had me like that sort of raw and emotional. And I was very taken by surprise. As a therapist, why isn't this book more pedagogical? Why did you like really dive into this sort of human side of everything? Yeah. So in the book, I follow the lives of four of my patients and there's a fifth patient that I follow who's me as I go through something in life and then go to my own therapist. And I really wanted to tell stories because I feel like we see ourselves reflected most clearly through the lens of other people's stories. I feel like if someone says to you, you do this or you're like this or this is the thing that's keeping you stuck. We say, I'm not like that. I don't do that.",

So what I want to know is you, you talk a lot about like, Hey, we want to get out of the headset. Do you really, do you want to get out of the headset or do you want to manipulate the headset? Well, when I say we want to get out of the headset, that's as a scientist trying to look for a deeper theory. So as a scientist, I mean, we've sciences, let me ask you. So the reason that Einstein, his breakthroughs were so useful is within the headset. They let us do something. Are you trying to do something in the headset?

We were very cognizant that pairing up is a problem. So if two of us are really close, because I mean, we were together for 14 years. So over that time, it's like inevitably one time you're feeling close to one person, the other, you're feeling closer to the other person.

We enter into these relationships that we want for life with zero agreements and zero way to talk through them. So what happens is we end up having all of these disposable relationships. And the second something hard comes up, we're like, see ya. It's just easier to write it off or to let it go because you just don't want to deal with it. You don't want to confront it.

And worry can start to trigger more anxiety. So if we're anxious, that triggers worry and that worry triggers more anxiety. We can start to see how that spirals out of control. I think of this as like going over the event horizon into that black hole of anxiety. It's just, it's really hard to pull yourself out. And so now when people find themselves in this loop, what are some of the things that they can do? So you've got a whole book obviously called Unwinding Anxiety or an app, excuse me.

Because otherwise, humans, when spring came late, because we burned so much glucose in our brain, we wouldn't have been able to make it. And this is the mechanism by which fasting-mimicking diets and keto diets play. If you go on a very high-fat diet, or a high-fat, high-protein diet, which some people do, and you don't eat carbohydrates, this fasting mechanism kicks in. So your brain changes over to burning ketones. You go into ketosis, and it has a hunger blunting effect. When you're in a ketotic state, you don't feel hunger. And as a consequence, it helps people that are trying to do short-term weight loss.

So men, just so many men dying before getting to reproduce. So let me say this another way. One guy was getting 17 women pregnant on average, and then guys were getting zero. Our men were dying before getting a chance to reproduce. So remember, this is a time of a lot of mortality. So a lot of men. Wouldn't it have to be what I said is true. One guy on average was getting 17 different women pregnant. Yes.

Because obesity is a signal that you've got your body in grow, grow, grow mode. Well, obesity is often though not always accompanied by high signals of growth and inflammation, which gets back to, you know, are you a metabolically healthy or unhealthy obese person? If you're metabolically unhealthy and obese, that means it's by definition accompanied by high growth factor, high inflammation, high glucose, and all of those things are destructive to your health. So is the fat becoming inflammatory because it sends out a hormonal signal or it sends out inflammatory signals when it's not in the fat cell, when it's not in the right fat cell, when it's not in the subcutaneous fat cell. Got it. So those visceral, those fat droplets that are around the organs are sending out inflammatory signals. So when we're looking at an obese person, just to beat this point to death, really the, we're just concerned about, I'm going to guess, given that you're obese, that you're probably leaking fat into the system that is becoming visceral fat, which is just loose using the water balloon analogy.",

Everybody started to look at genetics. Then that's the next huge paradigm shift, is that we were trying to understand at a deeper level. We weren't saying that cancer cells didn't grow. The question we're trying to ask is, why are they growing? We said, well, the answer now is that they have genetic mutations that lets them grow too much.

The Game of Thrones is not a game that I like to get involved in because everybody speculates. We don't know. All I know, Chinese are stimulating. They want the economy to grow.

That's really interesting. In the book, you talk about solitude deprivation, which I found really interesting. So one, define solitude, which I thought was interesting that you took the time to do that. And then why it matters. Yeah, so we think about solitude in different ways. But the definition I liked came from another book. It was called Lead Yourself First. It was a book about solitude and leadership. But the definition they used in this book was that solitude is freedom from input from other minds. So it has nothing to do with physical isolation. In this room, you could certainly be in solitude if you were just alone with your own thoughts, but if you're up on a mountaintop completely isolated but have earbuds in, you're not in solitude. So it's nothing to do with physical isolation. It's what mode your brain is in.",

And so to come full circle is, you know, my father would say to me, courage, you know, it's normal to be scared. It's normal to be scared. We all die. And what I understood he was teaching me is that courage is not the absence of fear. Courage is fear walking. Courage is about feeling your emotions, not pushing them aside, trying to do away with them or rationalizing why you shouldn't feel them. Courage is about feeling them with compassion, with curiosity, and then even if it is uncomfortable taking steps towards things that are of value to you, uncomfortable because starting a new business is tough. Sometimes reaching for your dreams brings difficulty, and this is why we need courage. So what is the impact that I would like to have? Very long winded answer, but it is about helping people to be, to be with themselves in compassion, in curiosity.",

And they're not going to feel powerful if you're better than them at a lot of traditionally masculine things, leadership being the easiest one to peg to. They actually produce more cortisol in relationships with women that earn more than them or take more dominance. So they literally experience more stress biologically and biochemically, which actually decreases their testosterone. So they have less sexual desire and more stress when they're around a woman who's more successful than them. Isn't that weird? It is not weird at all to me. It's fascinating, but that rings so true. And there's a great quote, of course, said by a man, but everything is about sex. Except sex, that's about power.

But you have to understand that there is an upper bound to that and that you can push yourself to the point of breaking down. So if you get there, make sure that you recognize that doing less is always an option, should be a tool in your toolkit. And when you get to that point, back off, back off. It's that simple, but you've got to earn that trust with yourself. So those were the two examples from my life. That was how I managed to get myself out of those situations and may those examples serve you as well as they serve me.

So for me, it's like impact theory is here so that if you take our advice, the advice of our mentor characters on the entertainment side, or in these interviews that it will actually improve your life as determined by that formula that I laid out for fulfillment. Yeah. I think this is another part of it. It's not just in my part of the problem or the solution, but like, am I acting with honesty, good ethics, decency, you know, how am I doing what I'm doing? Right. Another problematic character, but I was at American apparel for a long time and I remember someone was proposing to Dove that he could like move the factory overseas and, you know, make more money or something.

And Chris Williamson brought me on to talk about this very thing with him. We talked about this dystopian future of A.I. girlfriends and things like that. And one white pill that we thought about might be that incels or sexless young men might use a very sophisticated, artificially intelligent girlfriend. Yes, they might retreat from the mating market altogether, and, you know, this A.I. girlfriend might leap out of the uncanny valley and even surpass a flesh and blood girlfriend, but it wouldn't come with the status.

And they quit because they feel badly about themselves. At some point, something gut checks you about are you good enough, smart enough, worthy, whatever, and people come up wanting, they've got the negative voice in their head, they don't have the right value system, whatever, but they implode because they've got the negative voice, it's running unchecked, they don't have a way to anchor themselves, which I would say the thing to anchor yourself around is improvement itself.

So for me, I try to gauge these things in a more what I deem to be realistic way, because I want a high quality of life, too.

And you can think of horrible things, but the individual actor thinks what they're doing is good to them or for them in some way, otherwise they would not do it. So we can't do anything about that.

Third thing that I think is very important to succeed in motorsports is to have that mechanical inclination of how a car works, to understand suspension, to understand the aerodynamics. That's the mechanical side of it to be successful. And in all honesty, the fourth element is what I would call timing and luck. But luck is defined in my theory by preparation meets opportunity.

So, you know, when you cut your hand or something, your skin, and then there's a little hole and then it gets right around the hole, like that's inflammation. That's your body sending a bunch of stuff to help repair the cut. So it's a state of alert. It's a state of alert that your body goes into and it's usually very beneficial.

I think you absolutely have to write it down, right? Because when you write it down, you internalize it more.

It kind of is like insulin resistance, like insulin's not performing what it wants to actually do. And do you know, does the body respond to that by producing more insulin? Thinking like, oh, I just need to keep shoving more in to get this out of the bloodstream. To see if they can, so insulin levels will rise. And so basically, if you have too low amounts of body fat, you don't have enough adiponectin, all right? What happens is that your insulin's not functioning properly, your body will make more insulin to see if it's, maybe the problem's insulin, let's make some more insulin.

So if suffering is sort of a constant, you can always find it. Despair and meaning are inversely proportional.

You can save money in an S&P 500 index fund. You can't save money with bonds unless unless you're buying bonds and the interest rates keep getting reduced. If you if you bought a bond at four percent yield and the interest rate got taken down to three and a half, the bond trades up. And when the interest rate goes down to three, it trades up again. And when it goes down to two and a half, it trades up again. When the bond rates get or the LIBOR, you know, the short term bond rate and interest rate goes to zero, you can't take it down anymore.

So no matter what, whether you have trouble with peeing at night or not, you want to make sure that starting three hours before you go to bed, you've finished all of your food intake.

In that scenario, I'm going to guess that they're in index funds, like you said. And what is an index fund? It's just a collection. It's a collection of stocks. It is diversified, usually. There are index funds that are just in healthcare or tech. But when I talk about index funds, I'm talking about like S&P 500 index funds. It's well diversified.

That is certainly what I struggle with the most in my own life, that I was simply, when I had a negative view of myself or anything else, that I was simply recognizing the truth of the situation, not understanding how the belief I had about the thing was influencing my behaviors and my behaviors entirely determined my outcome.

Long lasting relationships. Why is that good? Because I think what happens with long lasting, firstly, they're more likely to create a shared meaning and purpose. Also, what happens is you end up knowing that you start to learn to reject things. If I know I'm going to stay with you forever, what will happen is I reject maybe going to clubs every night because I know who I'm going to be home with. I reject dating multiple people at the same time. I reject sleeping around because I know where I'm ending up. But why are those good things?

In Italy, it's antipasti. In the Middle East, they often have herbs by the bunch on the table before the meal starts. And the reason this works is because of that fiber in the vegetables.

Again, I'm not sure the volatility interim, but it went from basically 50 to 20. Now, was their interim volatility closer down to zero? Perhaps. We've talked about this a bit before, but ultimately these miners, you know, they're this big. They're shoeboxes. You unplug them from one place and plug them in another place.",

And I've resisted it. And the reason I've resisted it, even though US China is in a horrible place right now, and the relationship is getting worse, it's not getting better. But I think it is more likely within three, five years, that AI companies cutting edge in all sorts of fields will actually be all over the world. I don't I think this is going to be a proliferating technology for good and for bad.

It sort of trained us to think of it like this constant companion that we always need to be looking at in every downtime. But that's very recent, and it's very contrived, and it's causing a lot of trouble. So how do we begin to carve out that space for solitude? Are there things that we can do? I know you've talked about walking. What are some things that people can do to train themselves? Because obviously now most people are in a very, like you said, Pavlovian response cycle where it's not going to happen by accident for them to stop.

Guess what just happened with coffee today, this and that. It's just, I enjoy it. What are the big levers that you pay attention to? Obviously the Fed raising rates, all that stuff matters or does it? It certainly seems to from my layman's position. Yeah, it does. I think it has a huge impact on the market. I think inflation, I pay attention closely but I also know that it's not exactly rooted in what a lot of people are experiencing. What do you mean by that?

And they explained to me that right now, if you go across the meta-studies on depression, which is out of control since COVID, obviously. It's not COVID as much as it was the shutdowns and the fear. And then now the fear of people, you know, a lot of people are afraid we're going to all die within 12 years, which of course is not true in terms of the environment. But all of this fear has put people in a place where there's no compelling future. And that's one of the things that we all need.

So I just don't believe that that is, I believe that was true in your actual experience, but I would say something was not great with the program, or something else in your physiology was kind of strained to a level that your adaptability was just smolderingly small. And so we would need to figure out what that was at the time. Could have been job stress, could have been CO2 tolerance, could have been connection to your own physiology. Like, there's all kinds of areas that this could be in, and we've seen them all. Or it could have been something else going on. So we would have gone and found those things and said, we're having you do A, B, and C. Could be very simple, could be not. And then here's your new training program.",

So they did a study where they removed the amygdala on a bunch of chimpanzees, released them back into the wild, they had an inability to feel fear. And so within something like within 48 hours, they were all dead, because they wouldn't avoid a predator, they wouldn't avoid limbs that were too small.

It means that they are able to process their food without having huge insulin spikes. It means that they have normal levels of energy. Their inflammation levels are not through the roof, which by the way, is a matter of training, sleep, discipline, food. Their diet is very specific as well.

So I just want to anchor everybody back around to those money habits you've got, what all my mom would have called pissing money away, right? Literally in alcohol, you're just pissing that money away. Or putting it into something that's going to go to work for you. In your case, it was a business. It was real estate.",

And some days I was able to go into pitch black this, it depended on the day, but I knew that there was no way to getting better unless I got pretty damn uncomfortable almost every single time. So I just knew that to be the case. And like I said before, I think the ability to push really hard past the initial, uh, you're in pain, you're in pain. What are you doing? Stop right now. You know, like your body says for survival mode was just the reality that I knew that it was going to get, make me better. And it was going to be over soon. That was really part of it because it was not ever over for a very long time in my eating disorder. It was like, what is this going to be? You know, I mean, 30 seconds, we're doing minute intervals, you know, we're doing 10 minute intervals or we're doing five, you know, five minute intervals.",

And the other one was one of the first, not first, one of the only books anyone had ever pitched on hypnotism, How to Do Stage Hypnotism at Home, and How to Hypnotize Your Friends to Get Them to Act Like Chickens. No one wanted to publish that either. And I just kept kind of one thing after another that was either clever, and I was proud of myself for being clever, or because I had an MBA, I had spreadsheets to prove that people would actually buy the book. And then what came to me, no one explained it to me, but what I figured out was the people in the book industry who tended to go to famous colleges were dramatically underpaid, really underpaid.

Does it really just come down to there's something, it's compelling them to eat more, but this is still a calorie problem? Or is it compelling them to eat carbohydrates and that's our problem? I think it's the latter. So I think they're pointed towards foods that are likely to be fattening for them. They can have arugula, but it's not gonna fill them up. Therefore, their brain is saying you've got to have something else, have some bread with it or whatever it is. And they're not satiated in the same way that other people would be. They don't get that sensation of fullness. Those hormones are not kicking in. And it's a bit of a vicious circle because these people are, because they're getting these sudden impulses to eat, they're not able to plan all their eating as well as other people. They have these huge drives of their body to do this.",

So in my opinion, a lot of things, even huge departments, practices in business and medicine and everything come down to learning and communication. And so let's define terms. So learning is same condition, new behavior. So to the point I felt sad last time I learned this new thing from this podcast on impact theory, which is okay, if I feel sad, then it means that I don't see an option, which means I need to get more education or knowledge on the subject so that I can figure out what to do. Well, at least deciding that I need to learn more gives me the next step that I need to do. And boom, I'm not sad. And so you've been sad before, and then it took you five days to get out of it. And you're sad now, and it takes you five minutes to get out of it. Same condition, new behavior. So you learned. And so if we go one degree move from that, I'm going to circle back to the original point.",

So it's very interesting that that started out very early for you. That definitely did not start early for me, but you do begin to realize, okay, in disruption, there is opportunity. One of the things that, given the way you talk on Undercover Billionaire, I'm guessing that this is true for you as well, what Ray Dalio calls principles, that you do something in life and you realize, okay, that worked, that didn't work. And so you begin to formulate these things. The next time I encounter this, I will act in this way. And one of the like hard and fast beliefs that I have is in disruption, there is opportunity.

So, you know, you have a rebrand exercise. The bottom has fallen out. You're a felon now. Sort of logically, it's all over. But you sit down and you say, what's my monetizable asset? How do you even begin to think to ask the question? What's my monetizable asset? Like, how are you beginning to put that worldview together that tells you this is doable? OK, well, I have like kind of a two part answer for that. First of all, I think it had a lot to do with being in survival mode. Define survival mode. I've heard you talk about this.

People our age do not understand how much the world has changed. Go watch Mr. Beast. As I started binging his content, I was like, oh my God, everything is different. And I know it, but kids today do not understand that TV was just different when you and I were growing up. True story. And what they also can't appreciate is that they're going to be old one day, and YouTube and all that is going to be outdated and super dumb. And it will have so ingrained itself in the patterns in their brain that they'll have a hard time breaking out of it.

We have robots that do experiments, again in biotechnology, where the number of experiments is in the millions. A human cannot specify a million different things to try by hand. A machine can. A machine with the right code. And that machine doesn't need to have any wants, it just needs to do Bayesian inference, if you want the technical term, it just needs to do Bayesian inference. So yeah, bottom line is we can have hugely useful machines that are incredibly smart, but have no wants whatsoever. Okay, so it's becoming clearer to me now what our base assumptions are. So your base assumption is that I think AI already does all the amazing things you want it to do, is as dangerous as you could hope it to be as a tool for humans to use.

And if you're not like men, you're a prude. And basically failing to recognize that there are some differences between men and women on this point. And so there's this real movement now. And I think you see it playing out in the stats around sex, particularly in 20-somethings having less sex today than they were. And I think part of this is just actually a lot of women are like, hold on a second, hold on, hold on. Like, we're not like men on average when it comes to sex. Some women are more like men, some men more like women, the distributions overlap, but there's a pretty big difference in the kind of psychology of sex for men and women. There just is.",

But unlike nutrition, if you get exercise right, there's enormous upside. There is true life extension and remarkable health span extension, which might be even more important. I'm really, I'm bothered by that. And it- Why are you bothered by that? Because I hate exercise, dude, in a way that you can't imagine. So literally, while I was reading your book, which I always do as an audio format, I was doing air squats and sit-ups and stuff, because just hearing you talk about the importance of exercise, it really is the thing that I have always done out of obligation and never out of joy.

Often it's very counterintuitive but when you read it, it just makes sense. Because he's growing as his audience grows, you really get a overarching toolkit that's going to allow you to go in any direction that you want. I will say as somebody who's actually slightly out of his demographic, I still found it all insanely useful.
