So you you come to America you end up doing Extraordinarily well, what is the mindset that you begin to build that allows you to have that kind of extraordinary success? Once I saw you right? let's say like I saw Tom having a nice car or seeing like all these kids have cars and a girlfriend and flowers and prom and I'm like wait a second like you know Like why you have that and I don't and I start asking this question these people and I realize how the their process was You know, I started learning the American mindset and that's when I started detaching myself from being Albanian to become an American I made it I made a pact to myself.

        "v1BwF7XkkuM_43": "You look at someone like Sindhu Tai, you look at all of these incredible people that have broken barriers. You look at people who were told, Wilma Rudolph was told she would never walk again properly or run at age nine and went on to be a multiple Olympic gold medalist. When you hear that, you're like, what, really? But that's what's possible. And so no one in the victim mindset has ever seen growth from that mindset. But everyone who has traded that victim mindset for a mindset of acceptance, a mindset of healing, and a mindset of perspective has found their way out. And the mistake we make is we tell people what's almost like toxic mindset advice, where it's like, oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself. Just go out there and do the work. That doesn't work either because that person needs to accept that they've been through something painful for themselves. So you can't belittle or devalue someone's pain. And often people try and belittle and devalue their own pain to get out of it. But that actually just slows down the process and then they're back to square one again.",

And I remember saying to my wife, if I ever get to the point where you think, okay, this is now problematic. You say to me, this is problematic and I will instantly stop and turn around. But I'd be curious to know what you think about that level of discipline that anorexics have to have. And if you think that applied to your ability to get so fucking good and to suffer so much to become as, as impressive as you were on the bike. Oh, I'm absolutely positive that the suffering aspect played a role because I, I remember always thinking when I was cycling and, and any kind of, um, you know, aerobic endurance sport is, uh, involves an excruciating amount of suffering. Uh, so many people don't really recognize like the, the, the, the deep dark places you have to go to push past barriers to, to get better, to improve.",
        "Ll5EDt13GcQ_129": "So when we send them the $2 trillion, we are creating that money in order to make those purchases? Yeah. So we're not just taking money that we've already saved? Let's say there's $50 trillion circulating around the world and we just print $2 trillion more. Now there's $52 trillion. We've inflated the currency supply by 4%. We've devalued everything by 4% and we've traded $2 trillion worth of US dollars for $2 trillion worth of coal or oil or products or iPhones or labor or something, right? And that's the way it works, right? And the reason it works, what is the real export the US provides? Financial economic security. Like for example, if you live in Mexico or you live in Argentina and you've got a million dollars, are you going to save it in the peso? You're going to save it in the dollar, right? How are you going to save your money? If you export $100 billion of oil from the Middle East and we give you back $100 billion in dollars, what are you going to do with $100 billion? You buy T-bills with it.",

We're not having the thing you need when when you need it or not getting somewhere on time, not having the conversation. There's solutions to all those things if you just take control and figure out what's in your control and stop blaming the environment. And I use Mario because it's a prime example. The platform is not to blame. You can't blame Bowser. You can't blame the Koopa Troopas. It's Mario. You blame Mario. You are Mario. Those are some good references. So talk to me about your concept of F Plan B. Yes. F Plan B. I'm sure this is probably a thing in a lot of cultures, not just specific to Indian culture, but my parents always raised me with a huge, huge importance on having a plan and then a plan B. So something to fall back on. And that's very often how my parents viewed a degree as well. I would always be like, but I don't want to do psychology.",
        "ZNksisbRYvs_30": "The guy starting with a dollar, it's going to take him a lot longer to get to $100 million than the person that's starting with $10 million to get to $100 million. Takes a lot less doublings, right, to get there. Takes a lot less risky stuff. You've got a lot more things you can try that don't work. All of that. I'm not denying any of that. So scale becomes a question of how quickly you're able to generate that money. But you can play the same game. I actually want to call back to when you were talking about accredited investors. And so my understanding is they have certain income brackets or network bracket where you can jump into it because of how they view risk. And they're assuming, again, these people have more, I guess, bandwidth to take on that risk. And so I'm curious, for you, how does risk play into wealth generation? Because, again, timing also plays into it. Because in my head, when you're talking about the S&P 500 index funds, these are safe, right? Over long periods of time.",

The idea that I would plant is really to understand how our minds work so we can keep our prefrontal cortices online. That's one. I'm going to plant two. The second one is find what I call the bigger, better offer. And there are bigger, better offers than fear and anxiety and panic. They don't actually feel good. So if I could just plant, start planting the seed around kindness, connection and calm, they actually all feel better in our brain. And my lab's actually done research around this. So those are the bigger, better offers we're going to help guide ourselves toward. And the secret ingredient for that is awareness. Okay.

They've mastered the craft, and they've mastered everything around that craft. For us, it's about getting them to understand at a deeper level who they are and what they stand for is really their way forward. Again, that draws back from ancient Eastern philosophies of mastering of yourself versus mastery of the craft. We found over the years that if we explore your edges with you in a supportive but challenging way, you will bring your expertise to bear because you are the master, and you'll bring that to bear in a manner we probably haven't even thought of, and you'll take that opportunity to grow and evolve. That's how we came up with that phrase. Tom Bilyeu I love that you guys ... You're dealing with the best of the best.

And so another study we did, which will help build intuitions, we looked at alcohol dose response. So we said we had a placebo, a low, and then a medium alcohol. And so we found that when people had a low alcohol response, they became impaired. When they did behavioral measures, you couldn't identify their impairment. They behaved as if they were not impaired. We can see the impairment in the brain because the brain compensates for the impairment and the person performs as well in the task as though they were not impaired, but we can see it. When they became sufficiently intoxicated, they became so impaired. The brain lost its ability to make up for it. So this is the same thing that happens in cognitive decline. So cognitive decline starts many, many years before the behavioral measures happen because the brain is compensating for the decline.",

I do think there are ways to manipulate our level of desire, or our level of motivation, I guess kind of the emotional aspect of feeling fired up about something. I think most people, it's not hard for them to get fired up about something for a few days, it's once you get to week two that most people tap out, and so I think there's a lot of, I think people underestimate how influenced we are by our surroundings and our environment, and I think to make some of those early changes sustainable, you have to do a lot of interventions within your environment, whether that is throwing all the junk food out of your fridge, making it easier to get out of bed in the morning, putting the alarm clock on the other side of the room, or surrounding yourself with the right people that will make it easier to implement the desired change.",

So the thing is you have to respect their values. And what I mean by this is 99% of us in relationships are trying to make our partner respect our values. We want them to like what we like. We want them to love what we love. If I'm going to watch football on the weekend, I'd love for you to come with me. If I think that going to watch this is really important, you should be there. So we demand that our partner respects our value rather than respecting theirs. And I'll give a tangible example.

Sometimes I feel anxious, and what I realize is I just have to pee, and I was creating this whole story. One of the things he said is that you think of anxiety just as a peculiar sensation, like when you have an itch. When you have an itch, you scratch it if you can, and if you can't, you just let the sensation pass. He says, try to do the same thing when you feel anxious. Mindfulness meditators talk about that. It's okay. Just let it come in. Don't resist it. Breathe through it, and if you don't allow it to hijack you, it will just pass like just another sensation. That's really interesting.

Jason Miller Very much so. Tom Bilyeu In fact, people were calling you militant, if I'm not mistaken, when you first came out. Jason Miller Early. Now, they're just like, wow, that's so awesome, and grandma's like, this is so awesome. Man, I wish you would have said something when people were calling me militant and an activist and all this stuff. I didn't feel like it was militant, and I say that. My stuff was at least even with some of the concepts and things that Public Enemy was talking about, or X-Klan, or some of these old school groups, Professor X, and all these guys in the S1Ws, and everybody that was down with Public Enemy. It was trying to really, with my music, give folks some pride, some understanding, to remove some of the oppression. I think still to this day, we suffer from an intense amount of fear that I think is just genetically and through years of oppression built into our community.",
        "9I39boHZYjI_47": "So that's why I try and encourage women to prevent them going down that route. I think that's very wise. And it is hilarious to me how easy it is to manipulate men. Have you ever seen any side of that with working with successful men? Do you ever see it? Or do they not kind of tell each other what they do on the side? Yeah, guys are not going to be open about that kind of thing. Like what makes you putty in somebody's hands. I mean, you can sort of pick it up with some guys, but no. You don't see it as much, maybe because I live in Dubai. So I see the average 70 or 60 year old man walking around with a 24 year old model. And then you see what's happened. Like you see how he's got there. But what would have happened is years of feeling neglected or rejected. Now somebody just makes him feel alive. Although it's transactional, they're willing to pay that cost just to get that feeling. Yeah, I mean, it is utterly fascinating. Like people really need to understand men and women.",
        "l1BULYFf8qo_106": "And eventually, my interface is going to have to just give up because the whole point of the interface is the network of conscious agents is too complicated for you to grok. You can't grok it. So I'll give it to you one agent at a time. Here's Tom. Not even Tom's left and right hemisphere, just Tom. And then all the agents, if you want to, you can get out. If Tom will let you, we can go in there and look in his brain and we can... Tom will not let you. Yeah, I don't think he will. That's right. I wouldn't. That's right. So that's why the tool is showing us more complexity all the way down. It's a vast social network. And each agent isn't just a standalone. We're a combination of many, many other agents. And that's going to be one part of the theory that's really interesting is mathematically precisely looking at all the ways that agents can combine. But agents do combine. We'll be going to some new mathematics, I think something called infinite categories and topoi. Infinite categories, what?",

        "_2ZK9Y7QSmU_75": "Knowing how to be around women, no, et cetera. But then invaluable in a shipwreck? Yeah, when things go south and there's a really dangerous, physically dangerous situation that you are, you are willing to put yourself on the line and if necessary, sacrifice yourself for others, absolutely, that you will do what needs to be done. I gotta tell you, that sounds pretty good to me. And there aren't very many women who I've shared that with who say that's a terrible thing. Like when you say to them, do you want guys who are acceptable at a dance but would it be invaluable in a shipwreck? There aren't very many women that say, no, that sounds terrible, right? They get it. They understand what that means. What's the flip side for women though? Because I think there's something very telling. I'm not, I don't need a woman to be invaluable in the shipwreck. In fact, if I'm completely honest, in that moment, I go to the disposable male hypothesis. Absolutely, you wanna be the one that's invaluable. And that makes me feel good about myself."
